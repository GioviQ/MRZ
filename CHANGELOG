- Unit tests that test for unexpected '|' characters in certain positions
- Unknown enum variant in the MrzFormat enum with value 0

- For IDFRA, OptionalData1 now contains the last six characters of line one
- The exception type has been changed from Exception to FormatException
- Some exception messages have changed
- All MrzFormat enum values integer values are increased by 1 because of the new Unknown variant with value 0
- When unspecified, gender is now '\0', which is the default value of char
- When unspecified, string values are now string.Empty instead of null
- For IDFRA and SDL, Nationality is now empty instead of the same value as IssuingState, since the documents don't contain information on the owners' nationality
